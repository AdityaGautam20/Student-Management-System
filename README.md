# Student-Management-System

A simple **Student Management System** built using **Core Java** that helps us manage student records via a console-based interface. It allows us to **add, update, delete, search, and list** students. The data is stored using Javaâ€™s **HashMap** in memory and persisted to a file using **File I/O**.

This project was built to practice **OOP concepts**, **Exception Handling**, **Collections**, and **File Handling** in Java.
